- Add destinations one by one, specifying their name and duration of stay.
- Modify or delete chosen destinations.
- Visualize the planned route on an interactive map.

## Tools and Technologies

- Figma: For designing and prototyping.
- GitLab: For project management using Kanban boards, user stories, and issues.
- Git and GitLab: For version control and code storage.
- Docker: For containerization.
- npm and Node.js: For package management and backend runtime environment.
- React.js: For building the frontend user interface.
- TypeScript: For static type-checking.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
5. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the application.

## Docker Setup

1. Make sure Docker is installed on your machine.
2. Run `docker-compose up --build` to build and start the Docker containers.
3. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the application.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.
You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
